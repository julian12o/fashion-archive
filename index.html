    <h1>OsamaSon</h1>
    <p>Amari Deshawn Middleton, known professionally as OsamaSon, is a 21-year-old rapper, songwriter, and record
      producer hailing from Goose Creek, South Carolina. Born on May 20, 2003, he began his musical journey in
      2020 under the moniker PradaUMari, later transitioning to OsamaSon in 2021. He gained prominence within the
      underground rap scene with tracks like "Cts-V" and "Troops" in early 2023. His debut studio album, Osama
      Season, was released in July 2023, followed by Flex Musix in December 2023, and Jump Out in January 2025,
      which charted at number 151 on the Billboard 200. OsamaSon is renowned for his experimental "maximalist
      rage" sound, characterized by heavy bass and synths, drawing comparisons to artists like Playboi Carti and
      Chief Keef. Despite challenges such as frequent music leaks, he continues to make significant strides in the
      music industry, embarking on tours and collaborating with various artists.

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>His Influences </h3>
        <p>Playboi Carti – Known for his atmospheric and experimental trap sound, Carti's influence on OsamaSon is
          evident in his maximalist rage style, use of heavy bass, and minimalistic, yet catchy hooks.</p>
        <p>Chief Keef – As a pioneer of drill music and a major figure in the Chicago rap scene, Chief Keef's raw,
          gritty style and impact on the trap genre likely influenced OsamaSon's approach to aggressive beats and
          street-inspired lyrics.</p>
        <p>Lil Uzi Vert – Uzi's genre-blending approach, mixing elements of punk rock, emo, and rap, resonates with
          OsamaSon's experimental musical direction. Both artists share a similar energy and playfulness in their music.
        </p>
        <p>Young Thug – With his unpredictable vocal style and willingness to experiment with different flows, Young
          Thug's influence can be heard in OsamaSon’s willingness to push boundaries and take creative risks in his
          music.</p>

          Off-White, and Nike, known for their bold logos and modern designs. He embraces oversized hoodies, graphic
          tees, and baggy pants, a style popular in the underground rap scene.</p>
        <p>Designer Labels – In addition to streetwear, OsamaSon occasionally sports luxury designer pieces, such as
          Balenciaga, Prada, or Louis Vuitton. This blend of high fashion with streetwear showcases his versatility and
          ability to mix the casual with the high-end.</p>
        <p>Distressed and Edgy Clothing – Much like his musical style, his fashion often has an edgy, rebellious vibe,
          with distressed denim, oversized jackets, and items that appear worn or customized to fit his unique
          aesthetic.</p>
